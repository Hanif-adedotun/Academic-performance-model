# Academic-performance-model
We are attempting to make a Predictive Academic Performance Model using machine learning techniques. The end goal of this project is to create a model such that a student’s distinct feature-set may be used as an input for the model with the output resulting in a fairly accurate prediction of the student’s future academic performance.
